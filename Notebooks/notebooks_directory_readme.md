# Notebooks Directory

Welcome to the **notebooks** section of the AI for Science Collaboration repository! This is your go-to spot for example computational notebooks to kickstart your AI and science workflows.

## Structure

- **colab/**: Ready-to-run Google Colab notebooks for quick cloud access.
- **jupyter/**: Jupyter notebooks for local or private cloud execution.

## Getting Started
- **Colab**: Click a notebook link in the `colab` folder to open it in Google Colab. Just make sure you're logged in to Google.
- **Jupyter**: Download a notebook from the `jupyter` folder, and run it using `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` on your local setup.
- **Wolfram**: The `wolfram` folder (coming soon!) will include Wolfram Language examples and instructions.

## Templates Directory
The **templates** folder has starter notebooks to help you begin quickly with a consistent structure. Use and modify them as you need!

## Environment Directory
The **environment** folder has guides for setting up cloud compute environments:

- **AWS**: Steps for setting up Colab or Jupyter on AWS.
- **Azure**: How to create a cloud environment with Azure.
- **GCP**: Instructions to use Google Cloud Platform for your notebooks.

## Contributing Made Easy
We’d love your contributions! Here’s how:

1. **Create Your Notebook**: Use Colab, Jupyter, or Wolfram.
2. **Submit It**: Email your notebook to [contribution@ai4science.com](mailto:contribution@ai4science.com) or use our [upload form](#).
3. **Review**: We’ll review and integrate it, and contact you if we need any tweaks.

Make sure your notebook has:

- **Clear Documentation**: Markdown cells and comments that explain each step.
- **Dependencies**: Include a requirements.txt or inline notes.
- **License**: Add this at the top:
  ```
  # Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file in the project root for full license information.
  ```

Thanks for contributing—let’s explore together!
