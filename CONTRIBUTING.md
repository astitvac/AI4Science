## 🌟 Overview

Aavishkar.ai creates open-source **Expert System Notebooks** that formalize scientific reasoning processes using LLM-based tools and structured knowledge representations. By contributing, you're helping democratize scientific AI and making advanced research capabilities accessible to everyone.

Our expert systems focus on five cognitive archetypes:

| Archetype | What It Does | Target Use Case |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **🔍 Literature Synthesist** | Analyzes research papers, extracts insights, identifies gaps | Literature reviews, research planning |
| **🧪 Experimental Designer** | Translates hypotheses into detailed protocols | Experimental planning, methodology development |
| **📊 Analytical Navigator** | Creates data analysis workflows with appropriate methods | Data analysis, statistical validation |
| **📝 Research Documentarian** | Structures research findings into clear documentation | Paper writing, result presentation |
| **🌉 Interdisciplinary Connector** | Maps concepts between different fields | Cross-domain research, novel connections |

## 📓 Expert System Notebook Structure

All expert system notebooks should follow this consistent structure:

| Section | Purpose | Required Elements |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Introduction** | Explains the notebook's purpose | Clear title, description, use cases |
| **Installation** | Sets up dependencies | Single cell with all requirements |
| **Environment Setup** | Configures API keys & LLM | Provider setup, configuration options |
| **Data Models** | Defines structured data | Pydantic models with validation |
| **Core Functions** | Implements reasoning | LLM chains or ReAct agents |
| **UI Interface** | Creates user interface | Gradio (or similar) interface |
| **Testing** | Validates functionality | Test cases, validation checks |

### Example Structure:

```python
# 1. Introduction (markdown cell)
# Clearly explain what the notebook does, who it's for, and expected outcomes

# 2. Installation (code cell)
!pip install langchain pydantic gradio langchain-openai

# 3. Environment Setup (code cell)
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# API key handling and LLM configuration

# 4. Data Models (code cell)
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
# Define your input/output data models

# 5. Core Functions (code cell)
# Implement your scientific reasoning processes

# 6. UI Interface (code cell)
import gradio as gr
# Create your user interface

# 7. Testing (code cell)
# Include validation and test cases
```

## 🧩 Contribution Guidelines

Expert systems require four essential components. Your contribution should address these key dimensions:

### Knowledge Representation

Use Pydantic models to create structured ontologies that organize domain concepts:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator
from typing import List, Optional

class ResearchConcept(BaseModel):
    """Model representing a scientific research concept."""
    name: str = Field(description="Name of the concept")
    definition: str = Field(description="Clear definition of the concept")
    importance: str = Field(description="Importance in the research context")
    
    @field_validator('importance')
    @classmethod
    def validate_importance(cls, v):
        """Validate importance is high, medium, or low."""
        if v.lower() not in ["high", "medium", "low"]:
            raise ValueError("Importance must be high, medium, or low")
        return v.lower()
```

### Reasoning Mechanisms

Implement scientific thinking using LCEL chains or ReAct agents:

- Create clear prompt templates that guide the LLM
- Break complex reasoning into distinct, verifiable steps
- Include chain-of-thought prompting for transparent reasoning
- Handle error cases and edge conditions

### Validation Architecture

Implement verification systems to evaluate outputs against methodological standards:

- Include confidence scores or uncertainty estimates
- Validate outputs against known scientific principles
- Provide clear indications when results should be treated cautiously
- Implement fallback strategies for unreliable outputs

### Collaborative Interface

Design interfaces enabling human-AI distribution of cognitive labor:

- Create intuitive Gradio interfaces with clear input/output sections
- Include explanatory text and tooltips
- Provide multiple output formats (text, visualizations, downloadable files)
- Enable iterative refinement of results

## 📏 Code Style & Quality

Maintain high-quality code to ensure your contributions are accessible and maintainable:

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 conventions
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings with clear descriptions
- **Variable Names**: Use descriptive, meaningful names
- **Comments**: Explain complex operations and reasoning
- **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling with helpful messages
- **Modularity**: Keep functions focused on single responsibilities
- **Type Hints**: Use Python type hints to clarify function signatures

### Example of Well-Formatted Code:

```python
def analyze_scientific_text(
    text: str, 
    domain: str = "general science",
    depth: str = "balanced"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze scientific text to extract key concepts and findings.
    
    Args:
        text: The scientific text to analyze
        domain: Scientific domain for context (e.g., "biology", "physics")
        depth: Analysis depth, one of "quick", "balanced", or "thorough"
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results with keys:
        - concepts: List of extracted scientific concepts
        - findings: List of key research findings
        - gaps: Identified research gaps
        - confidence: Overall confidence score (0-1)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If text is empty or too short
    """
    if not text or len(text) < 100:
        raise ValueError("Text must be at least 100 characters")
        
    # Implementation details...
```
