## AI-Powered Expert Systems for Scientific Research

Hello! Whether you're a seasoned researcher or a citizen scientist just starting your scientific journey, we're thrilled to have you here. Aavishkar.ai is your friendly companion in scientific research - we are a small community driven effort that seeks to promote more collaboration between Scientists and Technologists. 

## üåü Building with AI for Science

We combine the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Human Scientific expertise to create templatized "Expert Systems" as tools for scientific tasks.  that feel natural to use while maintaining rigorous scientific standards. Our expert systems help you:

- **Explore Literature More Effectively**: Like having a tireless research assistant who can read thousands of papers and find the connections you need
- **Design Better Experiments**: Get suggestions and validation for your experimental designs, ensuring robust methodology
- **Analyze Data More Deeply**: Uncover patterns and insights in your data with advanced analysis tools
- **Document Research Clearly**: Generate clear, well-structured documentation of your methods and findings

No matter your technical background, we've made sure you can access these powerful tools!
