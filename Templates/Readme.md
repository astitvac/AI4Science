# Templates Directory

Welcome to the **templates** directory! This folder contains starter notebooks to help you quickly kick off your AI for Science projects with minimal setup and a consistent structure.

## What Are Templates?
Templates are pre-built notebook structures designed to give you a head start on your projects. They include common configurations, helpful comments, and often-used dependencies, so you don’t have to start from scratch every time.

## How to Use the Templates
1. **Browse and Choose**: Browse through the different templates available here. Each template is tailored to a different use case, such as data preprocessing, LLM agent workflows, or simulations.
2. **Copy and Customize**: Download or copy the template that best matches your needs. You can use it as-is or customize it to suit your specific requirements.
3. **Run Your Notebook**: Follow the instructions provided within the notebook to start executing it in your preferred environment (Colab, Jupyter, etc.).

## Available Templates
- **Data Processing Template**: Pre-configured notebook for data cleaning and feature engineering.
- **LLM Agent Workflow Template**: Ready-made structure for building LLM-based agent workflows.
- **Simulation Template**: Template to get started with scientific simulations, including necessary environment setup.

## Contributing to Templates
We welcome your contributions! If you have a helpful template that you think others would benefit from:

1. **Create a New Template**: Make sure it's well-documented, with clear instructions.
2. **Submit It**: Send your template to [contribution@ai4science.com](mailto:contribution@ai4science.com) or use our [upload form](#).
3. **Review**: We will review and, if suitable, add it to the repository.

Please ensure that your templates include:
- **Instructions**: Clear steps on how to use and modify the template.
- **Dependencies**: A list of any libraries needed to run the notebook.
- **License Header**: Add this at the top:
  ```
  # Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file in the project root for full license information.
  ```

Happy templating and let’s build together!
