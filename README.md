<!-- This is a comment in Markdown -->
Welcome to the **AI4Science** repository! This repository is designed to help researchers use AI for scientific research. The goal of this repository is to curate a list of resources that can be used for building **Repeatable Research Containers** (RRCs) for scientific research.

### What is an RRC?

An RRC is a container that contains all of the code, data, and documentation needed to reproduce a scientific result on any kind of computing infrastructure. RRCs are designed to be self-contained, portable, and easy to use. They can be used to reproduce a result, verify a result, or build upon a result.

For a detailed explanation of RRCs, please see the following article

## Resources for AI4Science

If you're new to AI or scientific research, we recommend starting with the resources and tutorials listed in this README. These will provide you with a solid foundation for using AI in your research.<u>This resources list is not exhaustive and will be updated reularly through contributions from the community.</U>

### Tutorials

Here are some resources that can help you learn more about AI and scientific research:

#### <u>[Jupyter Hub Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/jbwhit/jupyter-tips-and-tricks)</u>

 Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to share code and data with others. They can be used to create interactive tutorials, share code, and collaborate on projects. This repository contains tips and tricks for using Jupyter Notebooks effectively.

* [AI for Science Summit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/event/ai-for-science-summit/)
* [AI for Science Community](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-science)

### Open source repositories

Here are some repositories that contain code related to AI and scientific research:

* [Microsoft Research AI](https://github.com/Microsoft/ai)
* [Google Research](https://github.com/google-research)
* [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai)

### Datasets

Here are some datasets that can be used for AI and scientific research:

* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
* [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

### Models

Here are some pre-trained models that can be used for AI and scientific research:

* [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/)
* [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/)

## How to build an RRC

I would start by using <u>[Jupyter](#jupyter-hub-tips-and-tricks)</u> to create a notebook that contains all of the code, data, and documentation needed to reproduce a result. This notebook can then be converted into an RRC using the [RRC Builder](
