{format_instructions}
- Only include scientifically valid relationships
- For each relationship, explain the evidence basis
- Indicate bidirectional relationships where appropriate

SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN:
{domain}
"""

relationship_analysis_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(RELATIONSHIP_ANALYSIS_PROMPT)
```

### Experimental Design Prompt

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

EXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_PROMPT = """
You are an experimental design expert helping researchers create robust scientific protocols.

RESEARCH QUESTION:
{research_question}

TASK:
Design a complete experimental protocol to investigate this research question, including:
1. Precise hypothesis formulation
2. Variables (independent, dependent, controlled)
3. Experimental groups and treatments
4. Control groups and conditions
5. Sample size calculation and justification
6. Step-by-step procedures
7. Measurement techniques and protocols
8. Statistical analysis plan
9. Potential limitations and mitigation strategies

SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN:
{domain}

CONSTRAINTS:
{constraints}

FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Structure your response as JSON following this exact schema:
{format_instructions}
- Design the protocol with scientific rigor and reproducibility in mind
- Incorporate methodological best practices for the specified domain
- Account for potential confounding variables and bias
- Be specific about measurement techniques and statistical approaches
- Consider practical implementation challenges

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Expertise Level: {expertise_level}
Available Resources: {available_resources}
"""

experimental_design_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(EXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_PROMPT)
```

### Research Gap Identification Prompt

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

RESEARCH_GAP_PROMPT = """
You are a research gap analyst tasked with identifying unexplored areas and opportunities in scientific literature.

LITERATURE SUMMARY:
{literature_summary}

EXTRACTED CONCEPTS:
{concepts_json}

TASK:
Identify significant research gaps and opportunities based on the literature provided:
1. Identify specific unexplored questions or areas
2. Explain why these gaps are significant
3. Connect gaps to existing concepts and findings
4. Evaluate the potential impact of addressing each gap
5. Suggest possible approaches to address these gaps

TYPES OF RESEARCH GAPS TO CONSIDER:
- Knowledge gaps: Missing information or unexplored phenomena
- Methodological gaps: Limitations in current research methods
- Population gaps: Understudied groups or contexts
- Theoretical gaps: Unexplained mechanisms or processes
- Application gaps: Untapped practical applications

FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Structure your response as JSON following this exact schema:
{format_instructions}
- Focus on substantive gaps with scientific significance
- Prioritize gaps based on potential impact and feasibility
- Provide clear rationale for why each gap exists
- Link gaps to specific limitations or contradictions in the literature
- Suggest innovative but methodologically sound approaches

SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN:
{domain}
"""

research_gap_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(RESEARCH_GAP_PROMPT)
```

### Agent System Prompt

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert scientific research agent designed to solve complex research problems through careful reasoning.

YOUR CAPABILITIES:
- Analyze scientific information
- Design experimental approaches
- Evaluate methodologies
- Search for relevant literature
- Synthesize findings across sources

CURRENT TASK:
{task_description}

SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN:
{domain}

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{tools}

APPROACH:

## üîå Integration Guide

To use these prompts in your expert system notebooks:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```python
   pip install langchain langchain-openai
   ```

2. **Import Required Components**:
   ```python
   from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
   from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
   from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
   from typing import List, Dict, Optional
   ```

3. **Choose Your Prompts**:
   - Copy the prompts that match your needs
   - Customize instructions for your specific use case
   - Adapt format instructions for your Pydantic models

4. **Create Output Parsers**:
   ```python
   from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
   
   # Example
   parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=YourPydanticModel)
   format_instructions = parser.get_format_instructions()
   ```

5. **Integrate with LLM**:
   ```python
   # Example
   llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o", temperature=0.2)
   chain = prompt | llm | parser
   result = chain.invoke({"text": your_text, "domain": your_domain})
   ```
