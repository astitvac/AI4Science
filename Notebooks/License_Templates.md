# License Templates

This folder contains license header templates that you can use in your notebooks and templates to maintain consistency and comply with open-source requirements.

## Available License Templates
- **MIT License**: This license allows others to freely use, modify, distribute, and even sell your code, while requiring only that the original copyright notice be retained.
- **Apache 2.0 License**: Similar to the MIT License but includes more explicit grant of patent rights.
- **GPL v3 License**: A copyleft license that requires derived works to also be open-source and under the same license.

## How to Use
1. **Choose a License**: Select the license that best suits your project. If you're unsure, the MIT License is a good default for most use cases.
2. **Copy the Template**: Copy the desired license header from below or use the LICENSE file directly.
3. **Add to Notebook**: Paste the license header at the top of your notebook or template to ensure clarity regarding permissions.

## Notes
- Remember to keep a `LICENSE` file in the root of your project for complete licensing details.
- Choosing the right license depends on your use caseâ€”MIT is generally permissive, while GPL ensures derived work stays open-source.
