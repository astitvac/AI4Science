> **AI-Powered Expert Systems for Scientific Research**

Welcome to the **[Aavishkar.ai](https://aavishkar.ai)** AI4Science repository! We build powerful AI tools that support scientific research through specialized "Expert Systems" - Jupyter notebooks that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for common scientific tasks.

## üåü Overview

Aavishkar.ai creates open-source **Expert System Notebooks** that combine the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with scientific expertise to accelerate research workflows. Our systems help researchers at any skill level by:

- **üîç Accelerating Literature Reviews**: Summarize, compare, and identify contradictions across dozens or hundreds of papers
- **üß™ Strengthening Experimental Design**: Generate and validate protocols with proper controls and sample sizes
- **üìä Streamlining Data Analysis**: Suggest statistical methods, check assumptions, and create reproducible pipelines
- **üìù Improving Research Documentation**: Create structured, citation-ready summaries and methods sections
- **üåâ Enabling Cross-Disciplinary Research**: Identify parallels between different fields and suggest novel connections

**Goal**: Let scientists focus on creative, high-level questions while AI handles time-consuming tasks, all while maintaining rigorous scientific standards.

## üß† Cognitive Archetypes

Our notebooks are organized around five scientific cognitive archetypes:

| Archetype | What It Does | For Researchers Who... |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| **üîç Literature Synthesist** | Analyzes papers, extracts insights, identifies gaps | Need to understand the state of a research field |
| **üß™ Experimental Designer** | Translates hypotheses into detailed protocols | Want to ensure robust, reproducible methodology |
| **üìä Analytical Navigator** | Creates data analysis workflows with appropriate methods | Need to analyze complex datasets correctly |
| **üìù Research Documentarian** | Structures research findings into clear documentation | Want help organizing and presenting findings |
| **üåâ Interdisciplinary Connector** | Maps concepts between different fields | Are exploring cross-domain research opportunities |

Each archetype uses chain-of-thought prompting and ReAct agents to ensure transparent, iterative reasoning.

---

## üìì Expert System Notebooks

Our cognitive archetypes are implemented as **Jupyter Notebooks** for several important reasons:

### Why Jupyter Notebooks?

- **Universal Accessibility**: Notebooks run across platforms (local, cloud, institutional)
- **Visual Clarity**: Code, documentation, and outputs appear together for easy understanding
- **Interactive Experimentation**: Users can modify parameters and see immediate results
- **Reproducibility**: Complete environment and workflow is captured in one file
- **Educational Value**: Notebooks serve as both tools and tutorials for scientific AI

### Notebook Structure

Each expert system notebook follows a consistent structure:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Introduction** | Explains the scientific objective and workflow |
| **Installation** | Single cell to install all required dependencies |
| **Environment Setup** | Handles API keys and initializes the LLM |
| **Data Models** | Pydantic models for structured input/output |
| **Core Functions** | Scientific logic and LLM interactions |
| **UI Interface** | User-friendly Gradio interface for interaction |
| **Testing** | Validation and quality checks |

### Key Design Principles

1. **Self-contained**: Each notebook manages its own dependencies
2. **Modular**: Core functions are separated and reusable
3. **Transparent**: Chain-of-thought reasoning is exposed to users
4. **Error-robust**: Graceful handling of unexpected inputs and LLM responses
5. **Extensible**: Easy to customize for specific research domains

These notebooks bridge the gap between AI capabilities and scientific workflows, making advanced AI techniques accessible to researchers regardless of their programming experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Choose Your Environment

Our notebooks run in multiple environments - pick what works for you:

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Colab (Easiest)
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. `File > Upload notebook` and select the `.ipynb` from this repo
3. Run the notebook and follow the instructions

#### üè¢ JupyterHub (For Institutions)
1. Upload the notebook to your institution's JupyterHub
2. Run cells to install dependencies
3. Follow the notebook instructions

#### üíª Local Environment (For Technical Users)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aavishkar-ai/expert-systems.git
cd expert-systems

# Optional: Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

### Quick Start Guide

## üîÑ How It Works

While each notebook is unique, they generally follow this pattern:

1. **Introduction**: Learn what the notebook does
2. **Setup**: Install dependencies and configure your environment
3. **Input Data**: Upload PDFs/papers or datasets
4. **Configure**: Set parameters for your specific needs
5. **Run Analysis**: Execute the AI-powered analysis
6. **Review Results**: Examine the outputs
7. **Refine**: Adjust parameters to improve results
8. **Export**: Save or share your findings

Most notebooks include a user-friendly interface (Gradio or similar) to simplify the process.
